export const proj_1_name = "Canadian Political Diversification Through Network Analysis"
export const proj_1_description = "With NetworkX and Gephi, Canadian Members of Parliament and Activist Organizations Twitter accounts retweets were analyzed for the brief period leading up to the 2021 federal elections. The object was to identify echo chambers that plague the scene and to find remedies in the form of bridge nodes that would serve to deliver a broader view for the people following. We found six main communities in Canadian politics, which we applied centrality measures, and information diffusion techniques to learn more about Canadian political interactions."

export const proj_2_name = "Canadian Energy Regulator Conditions Visualization"
export const proj_2_description = "Worked on frontend data visualization with React JS. The Canada Energy Regulator (CER) wanted their data to be more transparent and accessible to all external audiences: regulators, investors, pipeline operators and the general public. The CER was looking for a way for everyone to not just see the data but also interact with it. The main goal was to be able to gain insights and provide a storytelling platform for all peoples, leaving hundred line spreadsheets behind and translating them into meaningful information."
